# Metrics

Metrics is a tiny project which helps you with measuring compilation times in Android Studio across multiple users.
It provides information about times for each task and total time, build timestamp, files that have changed since last compilation,
git status or more data about machine the build was running.

### Installation

"Metrics" requires Flask, Redis and few packaged listed in requirements.txt

Work in progress...

Would be nice to implement these:
- compression of stored data
- charts
- data visualization of times between builds
- more ways to interact with data
